The code for generating the outfiles is in "ospf.cpp".

"infile" has all the links and cost ranges of the network to be emulated.
Outfile of the router <id no.> is "outfile-<id no.>.txt".

The bash script "routersetup.sh" executes all the processes for routers in parallel.
Parameters passed to the executable can be changed within the file.

Run "make" to generate the executable "ospf", "make clean" to delete the executable.

To generate the outfiles, run multiple instances in parallel.
The script can be used to do that.

Make sure the bash script "routersetup.sh" has the execute permission.
Run "chmod +x routersetup.sh" to make sure.
Run the bash script using "./routersetup.sh <# of routers> <name of the infile>", it executes multiple instances of the executable in parallel.
Use "Ctrl + C" to terminate all of the processes.
