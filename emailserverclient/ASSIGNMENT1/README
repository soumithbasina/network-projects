The code for email client and server are in the emailclient.c and emailserver.c files respectively.

Run "make" to compile and generate two executables "emailserver" and "emailclient".
The executables can be removed using "make clean".

You can provide the preferred port number as an argument to the executables.

Run both executables in different terminal windows, enter commands as follows.
./emailserver <port #>
./emailclient <ip address> <port #>

For the command Send, "###" must be entered in a new line to terminate the message.
